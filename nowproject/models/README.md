This folder contains the different layers and functions that compose our deep learning architectures.
* `layers_3d.py`, `layers_res_conv.py` and `layers_optical_flow.py` include the the layers used to build the models in `architectures.py`.
* `utils_models.py` contains functions used in layers.
* `architectures_2d.py` anf `layers_2d.py` feature respecitvely the archived 2D architectures and their corresponding layers that were considered at an earlier stage in the project.
